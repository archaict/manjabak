            Our goal as college student of Pradita Institute is making a pathway for people to learn coding as a language to convey their thought and creative mind. Coding for themost part was never taught as a second language for most people who born in 90’s and before. Coding was such a strange language that we can’t fathom with just see-ing, you learn the language, you learn the code, and then you intuitively write your code in such a way that can be understood in computer language. Think of it like this, you learn English as for the most part second language in asian cultured school, this is mostly true for we who live in Indonesia. We learn the language, the grammar, the conversational skill (that most of us is struggling with) and how to understand the words or sentences that we said. It’s the same for every language, and so it is for the code itself.

            Different Language for different kind of person. We live in an age and era in which computer language is thriving, you might understand lua, ruby, a bit of C, elisp, or anything else that live past 90’s era; but now, we live alongside many more, python, C into C++, php, etc.
            <br> Most of our time spent learning some language that might be easier for our mind to take, python as an example. Python can be used in so many ways, you can learn python for basic program, like making a calculator for example. Python can be used in many different platform, web apps, artificial intellegence (machine learning included), an erp program, small project, and everything else inbetween.
            <br> So, us, like most of you do, probably good in one language or another it might be easier to write a script in javascript than a python language, or making your multimillionaire project in a C language. We do have our preffered language, and we hope that the language that you want, will be a fluent language that you can proudfully show to the world.

            Semicolon Project is a non-profitable branch of coding industry based in Jakarta. Semicolon Project consists of three people from Pradita University. Our goal is to challenge you to go out from your ‘text’ comfort zone and do coding to break your bad habit. Coding is not a therapy that you’ll seek for the first time, it’s really far from it; coding is one of the most logical ‘playgrounds’ for people to learn to organize their own routine, life, and mind. It’s but a journey to immerse yourself in ‘sometimes’ an unfathomable art.
